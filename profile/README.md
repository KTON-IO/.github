# KTON - Institutional-Grade Liquid Staking Protocol for TON

![KTON Banner](./image/banner.png)

## Overview

KTON is a next-generation liquid staking protocol purpose-built for The Open Network (TON). Incubated by TONX Studio and backed by the TonCore (NEWTON) validator research team, KTON allows anyone to stake TON coins, receive a transferable yield-bearing token (the KTON jetton), and use that token across the growing TON DeFi landscape â€” all without forfeiting staking rewards.

## Vision

Our long-term vision is to make TON staking as liquid and ubiquitous as ETH staking, accelerating DeFi adoption and opening the door to sophisticated capital markets on Telegram's native blockchain.

## Key Features

- **Zero Lock-up**: Deposit or redeem at any time with instant withdrawal via swap pools
- **Low Entry Barrier**: Start staking with as little as 1 TON
- **Institutional-grade Security**: Audited contracts, role-based access control, and time-delayed upgrades
- **Telegram-native UX**: Mini Apps and bot integrations tap into Telegram's 1B user base
- **DeFi Composability**: $KTON integrates with DEXs, lending, and yield protocols across TON
- **Professional Node Operations**: Expert validators handle technical complexity while users share rewards
- **Transparent On-chain Accounting**: Real-time pool metrics via TonViewer & TONScan

## Problems KTON Solves

| Challenge | Traditional TON Staking | KTON Solution |
|-----------|-------------------------|---------------|
| Illiquidity | Funds are locked for the entire validator cycle | Stakers receive **$KTON** jettons that can be traded, lent or used as collateral |
| High Entry Barrier | Validator seats require 10,000+ TON | Pooling enables anyone to stake from **1 TON** |
| Operational Overhead | Running a validator demands 24/7 uptime & DevOps expertise | Professional node operators do the heavy lifting while users share rewards |
| Inflexible Rewards | Static APY, no optimization for MEV | *Planned* dynamic validator rotation and MEV capture aiming for **up to 8%** sustainable APY |
| Lack of DeFi Composability | Staked TON is isolated from the ecosystem | $KTON integrates with DEXs, lending and yield protocols across TON |
